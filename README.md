# Flappy Bird 

A really short project to replicate Flappy Bird using `SDL2`.

*Context: I created this project to understand better the library SDL2 in order to create a simple game engine.*

<video src="gameplay.mp4" controls="true" width="600px"></video>

## Install

**Please change the headers and library links beforehand in the `Makefile` so you can import correctly SDL2 from your local environment.**

Then run: 

```sh
# compile
make

# run the game
./run
```

To clean the pre-compiled and compiled files, you can also run the following command:

```sh
make clean
```

## WIP

- [ ] Add "Play" menu.
- [ ] Use sprites for pipes instead of red squares.
